# AsteroidMiner — Sprint 3 Snapshot (Current Game State)

## What the game is right now

A single “World” scene runs the whole loop. You pilot a ship with Asteroids-style thrust + turning, in a zero-gravity 2D space. Fuel is a hard constraint: thrust consumes fuel continuously; when fuel hits zero the game pauses and shows a “OUT OF FUEL — Press R to restart” label. There are a handful of big frozen asteroids spawned at startup as spatial reference points (currently just static obstacles/landmarks).

## Scene / node structure

``World (Node2D)`` is the root.

Inside it:

* ``Ship`` is an instanced Ship.tscn and is a RigidBody2D with the Ship script attached. It has lock_rotation = true at the node level, and it contains Camera2D as a child.

* ``Camera2D`` is enabled and uses position smoothing.

* ``UI (CanvasLayer)`` contains:

    * ``TuningPanel (PanelContainer)`` → ``VBoxContainer`` → five rows, each row has a label + slider for thrust, damp, turn, fuel burn, max fuel.

    * ``GameOverLabel (Label)`` hidden by default, centered-ish, shows the out-of-fuel message.

    * ``FuelBox (VBoxContainer)`` at bottom-left-ish: ``FuelLabel`` (“Fuel”) + FuelBar (ProgressBar). The bar is normalized to [0..1] by setting ``value = fuel/max_fuel``.

## Inputs assumed by code

The code uses these actions (must exist in Input Map): ``thrust``, ``turn_left``, ``turn_right``, ``restart``, ``toggle_tuning``, ``pause``.

## World logic (world.gd)

``World`` owns the “meta” loop: UI updates, tuning propagation, spawning test asteroids, pause/restart/game-over state.

On ``_ready()`` it does the following, in this order:

    1. Spawns a small set of “test asteroids” (5) using a preloaded Asteroid.tscn, sets each asteroid’s radius, sets it to frozen = true, and positions them around the ship’s starting position.

    2. Applies tuning values from the sliders to the ship (thrust, turn speed, damp, fuel burn rate, max fuel). This is done via _apply_tuning_from_sliders() and is re-applied whenever any slider changes.

    3. Refuels the ship to full (ship.refuel_full()), updates the fuel UI, hides the game over label.

    4. Connects all slider value_changed signals to _on_tuning_changed().

    5. Ensures the tree is unpaused; explicitly enables the ship camera and prints debug info about camera selection.

During ``_process(delta)`` it:

    * Updates the fuel bar every frame (normalized to max fuel).

    * Checks game over: if ``ship.fuel <= 0`` and not already game over, sets ``is_game_over = true``, shows the label, pauses the tree, and also forces the ship’s ``linear_damp`` to the slider’s max to stop drift.

    * Handles “restart” by unpausing and reloading the current scene.

    * Toggles tuning panel visibility.

    * Toggles pause (only if not game over).

Key detail: fuel UI updates even when paused (because it’s done in ``_process``), but physics thrust won’t run while paused.

## Ship logic (ship.gd)

The ship is a ``RigidBody2D`` with arcade-ish settings: ``gravity_scale = 0``, ``linear_damp`` default 0.9, ``angular_damp`` 6.0, and it hard-prevents spin/torque.

Movement is split across callbacks:

* ``_physics_process(delta)`` is where thrust + fuel burn happens only if not paused.

    * If ``thrust`` is pressed and ``fuel > 0``: it applies a central force in the ship’s local +X direction (``transform.x.normalized()``), and subtracts ``fuel_burn_per_sec * delta``.

    * After that it clamps ``linear_velocity`` to ``max_speed``.

    * There’s debug printing every ~0.33s while thrust is pressed, to confirm paused/freeze/custom_integrator/fuel etc.

* ``_integrate_forces(state)`` is used for turning and anti-torque:

    * Every physics step, it sets`` state.angular_velocity = 0.0`` so collisions don’t spin the ship.

    * If not paused, it reads turn input and directly modifies ``state.transform`` rotation by ``turn_speed * state.step``.

* ``_process(delta)`` only does one thing: if the tree is paused, it still rotates the ship visually using input, so you can “turn” while paused (even though physics isn’t integrating).

Fuel helpers: refuel_full() sets fuel = max_fuel; has_fuel() is fuel > 0.

## Asteroid logic (asteroid.gd)

An asteroid is a ``RigidBody2D`` that can be “frozen” (static) and has a procedural circle visual + collision driven by its ``radius``.

Important behaviors:

* ``radius`` is an exported property with a setter. Setting it triggers ``_apply_radius()`` once the node is inside the tree; if assigned before ``_ready()``, it sets a ``_pending_radius_apply`` flag and applies later.

* ``_apply_radius()`` always creates a new ``CircleShape2D`` so collision shapes aren’t shared between instances.

* ``mass`` is computed from area (``PI * r^2 * density``) with a minimum clamp.

* ``Visual`` is a ``Polygon2D`` generated as a 48-point circle polygon.

* ``frozen`` sets ``freeze = v`` and uses ``FREEZE_MODE_STATIC``.

Right now, asteroids are effectively static landmarks (frozen true in the world spawner), but the script supports dynamic ones.

## Current “game over”

The only death condition implemented is fuel depletion. When fuel reaches 0:

* ``World`` pauses the whole tree.

* ``GameOverLabel`` becomes visible.

* The ship is forced to stop quickly by boosting its linear damp to max slider value.

* Pressing restart reloads the scene.
